During winter break of 2016, I self taught myself openCV and various Computer Vision concepts. I learn best by doing projects so this repo contains all of my practices and mini projects with openCV 3.0 and python 3.5.

## Install
Python3.5 and OpenCV 3

Setting up openCV 3 with Python3.5 on MacOS is much complicated than I expected.
Please follow the exact steps of this guide to successfull install everything:

```

```

## Usage
```
python3 filename.py
```
<br>
For example:
```
cd 00-projects/
python3 live_sketch_using_webcam.py

```
