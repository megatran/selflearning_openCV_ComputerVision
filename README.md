# selflearning_openCV_ComputerVision

During winter break of 2016, I self taught myself openCV and various Computer Vision concepts. I learn best by doing projects so this repo contains all of my practices and mini projects with openCV 3.0 and python 3.5.

Setting up openCV 3 with Python3.5 on MacOS is much complicated than I expected.
